## Contributing

### Workspace layout

- `crates/gitcomet-core`: domain types, Git service contracts, merge algorithm, conflict session, text utils.
- `crates/gitcomet-git-gix`: `gix`/gitoxide backend implementation.
- `crates/gitcomet-state`: MVU state store, reducers, effects, conflict session management.
- `crates/gitcomet-ui-gpui`: GPUI views/components (focused diff/merge windows, conflict resolver, word diff).
- `crates/gitcomet`: binary entrypoint, CLI (clap), difftool/mergetool/setup/uninstall modes.

### Getting started

Windows prerequisites (Windows 10/11):

- Install Visual Studio 2022 (Community or Build Tools).
- Install the `Desktop development with C++` workload.
- Ensure both MSVC tools and Windows 10/11 SDK components are installed.
- This repo configures Cargo to use `scripts/windows/msvc-linker.cmd` for x64 and ARM64 Windows builds. The wrapper uses the active Rust toolchain's bundled `rust-lld` linker and discovers the MSVC and Windows SDK libraries, so `cargo build` works from a regular PowerShell/CMD shell. No separate LLVM installation is needed; the Visual Studio components above are still required.

Offline-friendly default build (does not build the UI or the Git backend):

```bash
cargo build
```

To build the actual app you'll enable features (requires network for dependencies):

```bash
cargo build -p gitcomet --features ui,gix
```

To also compile the gpui-based UI crate:

```bash
cargo build -p gitcomet --features ui-gpui,gix
```

Run (opens the repo passed as the first arg, or falls back to the current directory):

```bash
cargo run -p gitcomet --features ui-gpui,gix -- /path/to/repo
```

### Testing

Full headless test suite (CI mode):

```bash
cargo test --workspace --no-default-features --features gix
```

Clippy (CI mode):

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --no-default-features --features gix -- -D warnings
```

Coverage (local + CI-compatible):

```bash
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cargo install --locked cargo-llvm-cov
bash scripts/coverage.sh
```

This writes:

- `target/llvm-cov/lcov.info` (used by CI upload)
- `target/llvm-cov/html/index.html` (local detailed report)

### Release packaging

macOS packaging is handled by:

```bash
scripts/package-macos.sh --version 0.2.0 --arch arm64 --release
scripts/package-macos.sh --version 0.2.0 --arch x86_64 --release
```

Use `--skip-dmg` when running in restricted/sandboxed environments where `hdiutil create` is unavailable.

This fork's releases come from `.github/workflows/ggit-release.yml`: bump `version` under `[workspace.package]` in `Cargo.toml`, commit, and push a matching `v*` tag. It builds the Windows ZIP and publishes it as a GitHub Release, which the app's update check finds. Upstream GitComet's multi-platform release, Homebrew and AUR workflows aren't part of this fork.
