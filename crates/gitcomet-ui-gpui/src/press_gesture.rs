//! Ownership of the mouse press currently in flight.
//!
//! `div().on_click()` pairs press and release itself — gpui only remembers a
//! press that hit the element's own hitbox — so a click handler can never fire
//! for a release that began somewhere else. Hand-rolled `MouseUp` handlers get
//! no such pairing: they run for *any* release over their bounds, whatever the
//! press was doing. Dragging a text selection out of an input and letting go
//! over a commit row used to select that commit.
//!
//! So a gesture owner — text-input drag-selection, a resize handle, a scrollbar
//! thumb — claims the press in its own mouse-*down* handler with
//! [`claim_press`]. The shared canvas click adapter consults
//! [`is_press_claimed`] before acquiring a discrete press.
//!
//! The claim deliberately outlives the release: it is cleared at the *start* of
//! the next press, by [`install_reset`]. Clearing it on the release itself
//! would be too early, because the reset runs in the capture phase and the
//! handlers that read it run in the bubble phase of that same event.
//!
//! Every window that renders `view::window_frame` mounts the reset.
//! Standalone canvas roots also install the discrete-click reset through the
//! shared adapter; ownership never depends on a component's release handler.
//!
//! Discrete controls and canvas hitboxes use `kit::click` for completed-click
//! ownership. Menus obey the same rule; a release never transfers ownership.
